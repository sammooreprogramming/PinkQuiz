# Optimizing-Semantic-Elements
One of the most important goals in this project was to enhance the project using semantic elements, and an equally fundemental part of the criteria given was the request to have the website look the exact same as it did before its enhancement, visually speaking.

A change from non-semantic elements in index.html to semantic elements was made by replacing the original "div" and "span" elements with semantic ones to allow for the program's aesthetic to remain the same. This method utilizes the requested semantic elements, and this allows for a larger potential audience to be formed via the internet's search engines being able to find the site easier.

 For those with disabilities such as loss of hearing or sight, the 'alt' command was implemented into the code surrounding images so that a screen reader or other assistive tool can express them appropriately.

All links function properly.

All criteria have been met.
